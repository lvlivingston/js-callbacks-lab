// Exercise 1

// A fellow student shows you this code.  When he runs it, he expects it to
// wait three seconds, then write "Ding!" to the console.  Instead, it writes
// "Ding!" immediately.  Find the bug and fix it.

function writeDing() {
    console.log('Ding!');
}

let timerId = setTimeout(writeDing, 3000);
